We're all bored
We're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young
But we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doin'
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
